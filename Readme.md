# artificialgrammarlearning
This project delivers a software for investigating Artificial Grammar Learning (AGL) in a behavioral laboratory. It is mainly used in experimental psychology. 
AGL is a standard experimental procedure where subjects are shown a series of letter strings that follow particular complex rules. The clue is that subjects are initially not told about the rules and complete an unrelated task (e.g. a long-term memory task). Afterwards, subjects are told about the existence of rules, and are then told to classify a new set of strings into strings that matches and not matches this particular rule.
AGL strings are usually built according to a very complex finite state grammar rule.
